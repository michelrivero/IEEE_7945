## Compiling
# Download and extract the file shared on GitHub.
# Open the file using COMSOL.
# Refer to Table 1 of the article titled "Theoretical, numerical and experimental investigation of a Faraday disc generator for energy harvesting applications" to identify the pre-established domains and physical characteristics in the model.
# Locate the parameters labeled as "omegaX" in the COMSOL model and note down their corresponding velocities.
# Go to the electrical circuit-resistance section and find the value of the load resistance, which can be found in Figure 8.
# Next, run each simulation at different velocities (as indicated in Figure 8 in radians per second).
# In the studies section, first run the solution for the magnetic field and then proceed with the study that includes laminar flow, electric currents, and the electrical circuit.
Please make sure to follow these instructions carefully. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!
